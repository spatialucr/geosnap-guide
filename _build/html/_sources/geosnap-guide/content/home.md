<h1 align="center" style="margin-top:-10px">The Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package</h1> 


`geosnap` makes it easier to explore, model, analyze, and visualize the social and spatial dynamics
of neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods are important for a wide variety of reasons, but they’re hard to study
because of some long-standing challenges, including that

- there is no formal definition of a
  [“neighborhood”](https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2019/01/29/once-and-future-neighborhood) so
  identifying and modeling them is frought with uncertainty
- many different physical and social data can characterize a neighborhood (e.g. its
  proximity to the urban core, its share of residents with a high school education, or the
  median price of its apartments) so there are countless ways to model neighborhoods by
  choosing different subsets of attributes
- conceptually, neighborhoods evolve through both space and time, meaning their
  socially-construed boundaries can shift over time, as can their demographic makeup.
- geographic tabulation units change boundaries over time, meaning the raw data are
  aggregated to different areal units at differerent points in time.

To address these challenges,`geosnap` provides a suite of tools for creating socio-spatial
datasets, harmonizing those datasets into consistent set of time-static boundaries,
modeling bespoke neighborhoods and prototypical neighborhood types, and modeling
neighborhood change using classic and spatial statistical methods.
It also provides a set of static and interactive visualization tools to help you display
and understand the critical information at each step of the process.

**Batteries Included:**
`geosnap` comes packed with 30 years of census data, thanks to [quilt](https://quiltdata.com/), so you
can get started modeling neighborhoods in the U.S. immediately.
But you’re not just limited to the data provided with the package. `geosnap`
works with any data you provide, any place in the world.

## Installation

The recommended method for installing geosnap is with
[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). To get started with the development version,
clone this repository or download it manually then `cd` into the directory and run the
following commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geosnap 
python setup.py develop
```

This will download the appropriate dependencies and install geosnap in its own conda
environment.

## Development

geosnap development is hosted on [github](https://github.com/spatialucr/geosnap)
